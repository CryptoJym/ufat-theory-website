# UFAT Theory Website

## Universal Field Approximation Theory

A beautiful, interactive website presenting the Universal Field Approximation Theory (UFAT) - a grand unified theory for all existence, developed by the Grok 4 Meta-Agent System.

üåê **Live Demo**: [https://ufat-theory.vercel.app](https://ufat-theory.vercel.app)

## Overview

UFAT posits reality as a single timeless topological field (ùìï), where distinctions emerge from relational intersections of phase-spaces, measured by coupling (K ‚àà [0,1]). This theory unifies:

- Physical and metaphysical realms
- Consciousness and quantum mechanics
- Gravity and entropy
- Matter and antimatter asymmetry
- Origin of life and evolution

## Features

- üé® **Modern Design**: Cosmic-themed interface with animated backgrounds and particle effects
- üìä **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth scrolling with progress tracking
- üßÆ **Mathematical Formulations**: Beautiful rendering of complex equations using MathJax
- üì± **Responsive**: Optimized for all devices
- ‚ú® **Visual Effects**: Glassmorphism, gradients, and hover animations
- üìà **Comprehensive Tables**: Detailed predictions with validations

## Technology Stack

- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- MathJax for mathematical notation
- CSS animations and transforms
- Responsive design principles
